How Many Basic Types of Functions Are Available in Python? 


In Python, there are primarily two basic types of functions:

1) Built-in Functions

   -> These are pre-define functions provided by python.
   -> You can use them without defining them yourself.
      
      Eg. print(), len(), type(), input(), int(), string(), sum(), range() 


2) User define Functions

    -> These are functions you creating using the def keyword to perform specific tasks

       eg. def greet(name)
               return f"Hello, {name}!"
