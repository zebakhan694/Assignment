How memory is managed in Python? 

Memory management in python is handled automatically by the python interpreter using 
a combination of techniques and built in components.

1) Automatically Memory management

   you don't need to tell python to allocate or free memory,
   python takes care it automatically


2) Refrence Counting

   Evrey object in python keeps track of how many times its being 
   used that is called refrence.

   -> when you use variable, the count goes up
   -> when you are done using it, the count goes down
   -> if the count become zero, python deletes it to save memory


3) Garbage Collector

   sometimes object refers to each other and dont get deleted even if 
   you are not using them

   python has a helper called garbage collector that finds and deletes
   these unused objects


4) Efficient Memory use

   Python tries to save memory by:
   -> Reusing small numbers (like 1,2,3).
   -> Sharing the same string if it's used multiple times.
