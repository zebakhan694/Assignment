que :  What are negative indexes and why are they used ?

ans :  Negative indexe allow you to access elements from the end of a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string.

       Instead of starting the count from 0 (the first element), negative index start from -1 for the last element,
      -2 for the second last element.
      
    1. they provide an easy way to access elements from the end without calculating the lenght of the sequence.
    2. negative indexes are often used to reverse the sequence.
    3. saves time and reduces the risk of error in calculations.
