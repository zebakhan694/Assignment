Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

EXCEPTATION HANDLING :-

--> Exceptation handling is a mechanism that allows a program to handle runtime errors (Exceptations)
    gracefully instead of crashing.

--> it ensure that even if error occur, the program can continue exacuting or provide
    meaningful error message to the user.


ERROR :-

--> An error is a mistake in program that prevent it from running correctly.

--> Error can be broadly classified into two types
     
    1) Syntax Error (compile-time error)
       
       -> These occurwhen the python interpreter finds incorrect syntax in the code.
       -> They are detected before the program runs.

    2) Exceptations (run-time errors)

       -> These occurs while program is running.
       -> Even if syntax is correct, an error is happen due to invalid oprations(eg. dividing
          by zero, accessing an undefined variable)
       -> These can be handled using exceptation handling(try-except)
